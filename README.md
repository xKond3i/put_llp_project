# GROW A VILLAGE

**"GROW A VILLAGE"** [version IN-DEV]\
Simple digital clone of a "[CATAN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catan)" board game or a digital counterpart "[colonist.io](https://colonist.io/)" with a few twists. \
The rules are simple: roll the dice, gather and manage resources, buy and build roads and houses. 🎲 \
The goal is to claim the vicotry by developing the greatest village on the map. 👑
